constructors:
  - name: Create
    description: Create a new WebView.

methods:
  - name: LoadInitialUrl
    description: |
      Loads the initial URL to display in the attached WebContents.

      Creates the WebContents if none is attached yet. Note that this is
      intended as a convenience for loading the initial URL, and so URLs are
      navigated with PAGE_TRANSITION_AUTO_TOPLEVEL, so this is not intended as
      a general purpose navigation method - use WebContents' API directly.

      - name: url
