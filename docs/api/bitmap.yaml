  A ref-counted wrapper of SkBitmap.

  SkBitmap describes a two-dimensional raster pixel array. SkBitmap is built on
  SkImageInfo, containing integer width and height, SkColorType and SkAlphaType
  describing the pixel format, and SkColorSpace describing the range of colors.
  SkBitmap points to SkPixelRef, which describes the physical array of pixels.
  SkImageInfo bounds may be located anywhere fully inside SkPixelRef bounds.
