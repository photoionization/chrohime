name: Background
type: refcounted
inherit: Object
description: Background of `View`.

constructors:
  - name: CreateSolid
    description: |
      Create a background that fills the canvas in the specified color.
    args:
      - name: color
        type: SkColor

  - name: CreateRoundedRect
    description: |
      Create a background that fills the canvas with rounded corners.

      If using a rounded rect border as well, pass its radius as `radius` and
      its thickness as `border`. This will inset the background properly so it
      doesn't bleed through the border.
    args:
      - name: color
        type: SkColor
      - name: border
        type: int
      - name: radius
        type: float
