name: BlendMode
type: enum class
description: |
  Blends are operators that take in two colors (source, destination) and return
  a new color.

  Many of these operate the same on all 4 components: red, green, blue, alpha.
  For these, we just document what happens to one component, rather than naming
  each one separately.

  Different ColorTypes have different representations for color components:
      8-bit: 0..255
      6-bit: 0..63
      5-bit: 0..31
      4-bit: 0..15
     floats: 0...1

  The documentation is expressed as if the component values are always 0..1
  (floats).

  For brevity, the documentation uses the following abbreviations
  s  : source
  d  : destination
  sa : source alpha
  da : destination alpha

  Results are abbreviated
  r  : if all 4 components are computed in the same manner
  ra : result alpha component
  rc : result "color": red, green, blue components
