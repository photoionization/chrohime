  - name: SetAspectRatio
    description: |

      Note that for windows that have a client view that is framed by
      custom-drawn borders / window frame / etc, the window size will be chosen
      so that the aspect ratio of client view, not the entire window, will be
      `aspect_ratio`.

      Once set, some platforms ensure the content will only size to integer
      multiples of `aspect_ratio`.
