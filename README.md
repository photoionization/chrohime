# chrohime üë∏üèæ

Chrohime is a C library based on Chromium's `ui/views` library, for building
cross-platform GUI on desktop.

Goals:

* A standalone C library to be used by any program.
* Easy integration with scripting languages.
* Ability to be shipped inside Electron.
* Interoperability with Electron APIs.
* Interoperability with CEF APIs.
* Optional builds with Chromium content module.
* Simple implementation of React Native.
* APIs for system webview.

## Documentations

API references are not ready yet, but most APIs are commented in the
`chrohime.h` header, which can be found in the zip distributions in the
[Releases](https://github.com/photoionization/chrohime/releases) page.
